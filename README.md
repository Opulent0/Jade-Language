# About Jade!
### What is Jade?
> Jade is a small interpreted language I've started working on. It's written in Rust and the goal is to have simple syntax that can fit a wide range of needs.

### Why make Jade?
> Why not. It'll make me a better programmer and force me to learn something new.

### What's with the .bg file extension?
> # ***BIG GREEN***

### Not too sure what else to put here.
> Please ask any questions about the Jade and I'll answer them here.

# About Me
Hi. I'm Opulent, or as I mention in my main.rs, I'm Dyl. I'm currently (as of 5/6/2025, 11:55 AM until some time in 2026) a Cyber Security Student at a community college that I won't name as to stay Cyber Secure. Don't expect anything groundbreaking from this language, but do expect some weird quirks
and references to other languages I've used.
